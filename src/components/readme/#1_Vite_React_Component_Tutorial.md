# Vite + React Project: Component Refactor Tutorial

## Introduction

In this step of the Vite + React project, we refactored our application by creating a new `Hello` component and integrating it into the main `App` component. This tutorial will guide you through the changes made and explain each step in detail.

### Changes Made

1. **Created a New Component (`Hello.tsx`)**:
   - We created a new functional component named `Hello` in the `src/components` directory.
   - This component displays a greeting message: "Hello from the Hello Component!"

2. **Updated the Main Application File (`App.tsx`)**:
   - We imported the `Hello` component in `App.tsx` and replaced the "Hello World" text with this component.

### Step-by-Step Guide

#### 1. Creating the `Hello` Component

Navigate to the `src/components` directory and create a new file named `Hello.tsx`.

```tsx
// src/components/Hello.tsx
import React from 'react';

// Define a simple functional component that displays a greeting message
const Hello: React.FC = () => {
  return <h1>Hello from the Hello Component!</h1>;
};

export default Hello;
```

**Explanation**:
- We use a functional component with TypeScript (`React.FC`), which defines the component as a React Functional Component.
- The component returns a simple heading (`<h1>`) with a greeting message.

#### 2. Updating `App.tsx`

Open the `src/App.tsx` file and replace the content with the following:

```tsx
import React from 'react';
import Hello from './components/Hello'; // Import the Hello component

function App() {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <Hello /> {/* Use the Hello component */}
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

**Explanation**:
- We import the `Hello` component from `src/components/Hello.tsx`.
- Instead of rendering plain text, we now render the `Hello` component.

### Running the Application

To see the changes in action, start your development server using the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Visit `http://localhost:5173` in your browser. You should see the message "Hello from the Hello Component!" displayed on the page.

### Git Commit

After making these changes, here is a suggested Git commit message:

```
feat: add Hello component and integrate it into App.tsx

- Created a new Hello component at src/components/Hello.tsx.
- Replaced the "Hello World" text in App.tsx with the Hello component.
- Simplified the App structure by using a reusable component.
```

### Conclusion

This refactor improves the project structure by breaking down the UI into smaller, reusable components. It is a best practice in React development to keep components modular and organized, making the code easier to maintain and scale.

# EmployeeFormHandler Component Documentation

## Description

The `EmployeeFormHandler` component is a React functional component that provides a form for collecting employee information.  It uses controlled inputs to manage the form data and provides a simple submission mechanism.

## Interface: `EmployeeForm`

```typescript
interface EmployeeForm {
  name: string;
  email: string;
  department: string;
  jobTitle: string;
}
```

This interface defines the structure of the data collected by the form.  Each property corresponds to an input field in the form.

## Functionality

The component manages the form data using the `useState` hook.  The `handleInputChange` function updates the form data whenever an input field changes.  The `handleSubmit` function handles form submission; it currently displays an alert with the collected data, but this could easily be replaced with an API call to submit the data to a server.  After submission, the form is reset.

## Usage

The component can be used as follows:

```jsx
<EmployeeFormHandler />
```

This will render the employee form on the page.

## Example

## Props

This component does not accept any props.

## State

The component manages the following state:

- `formData`: An object of type `EmployeeForm` that stores the current values of the form inputs.

## Methods

- `handleInputChange`: Updates the `formData` state when an input field changes.
- `handleSubmit`: Handles form submission.  Currently displays an alert, but could be extended to submit data to a server.

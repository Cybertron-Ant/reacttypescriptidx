# HR Management System Documentation

## Overview

The HR Management System is a modern React application built with TypeScript that demonstrates best practices in React Hooks usage, state management, and component architecture. This system provides a comprehensive solution for managing employee data with features like filtering, searching, and basic CRUD operations.

```

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

For detailed setup instructions and examples, check out our [Tutorial](docs/hr-system/TUTORIAL.md).

## Architecture

### Context Layer

The application uses React Context API for global state management. The `HRContext` provides:
- Employee data
- Loading states
- Error handling
- CRUD operations

For detailed implementation, see our [Technical Documentation](docs/hr-system/TECHNICAL.md#context-implementation).

### Custom Hooks

`useEmployees` hook encapsulates:
- Employee state management
- CRUD operations
- Data filtering
- Performance optimizations

For hook implementation details, see our [Technical Documentation](docs/hr-system/TECHNICAL.md#react-hooks-implementation-details).

### Components

Components follow a hierarchical structure:
- App.tsx (Root component)
  - HRProvider (Context wrapper)
    - EmployeeList (Main feature component)

### Type Safety

The system uses TypeScript interfaces for:
- Employee data
- Department data
- Context types
- Filter options

For complete type definitions, see our [Technical Documentation](docs/hr-system/TECHNICAL.md#type-definitions).

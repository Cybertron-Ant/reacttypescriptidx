# React useMemo Tutorial: Optimizing Performance with Memoization

## Introduction
This tutorial will guide you through understanding and implementing React's `useMemo` hook using our fibonacci calculator example. You'll learn how to optimize performance by preventing unnecessary recalculations in your React applications.

## Prerequisites
- Basic understanding of React and hooks
- Familiarity with TypeScript
- Node.js and npm installed
- Browser developer tools knowledge

## Getting Started

### 1. Understanding the Problem
React components re-render when:
- Their state changes
- Their props change
- Their parent component re-renders

This can lead to expensive calculations being repeated unnecessarily.

### 2. The Solution: useMemo
`useMemo` allows us to cache (memoize) expensive calculations and only recalculate when specific dependencies change.

## Hands-on Tutorial

### Step 1: Basic Component Setup
```typescript
import React, { useMemo } from 'react';

interface ExpensiveCalculationProps {
  number: number;
}

const ExpensiveCalculation: React.FC<ExpensiveCalculationProps> = ({ number }) => {
  // Component implementation here
};
```

### Step 2: Implementing the Expensive Calculation
```typescript
const fibonacci = (n: number): number => {
  if (n <= 1) return n;
  return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2);
};
```

### Step 3: Adding Memoization
```typescript
const calculatedNumber = useMemo(() => {
  console.log('Calculating fibonacci...');
  return fibonacci(number);
}, [number]);
```

### Step 4: Creating the Interactive Demo
1. Open your browser's developer console
2. Try these experiments:
   - Change the input number and observe recalculation
   - Click the counter button and notice no recalculation occurs
   - Try different input values to see performance impact

## Practical Exercises

### Exercise 1: Monitor Performance
1. Open Chrome DevTools
2. Go to the Performance tab
3. Record while:
   - Changing input numbers
   - Clicking the counter button
4. Observe the difference in execution time

### Exercise 2: Experiment with Dependencies
1. Modify the useMemo dependency array
2. Try removing dependencies
3. Observe the effects on calculation behavior

### Exercise 3: Add Your Own Calculation
1. Create a new expensive calculation
2. Implement it with and without useMemo
3. Compare the performance differences

## Best Practices

### When to Use useMemo
✅ Use when:
- Calculations are computationally expensive
- Values are used by multiple components
- Preventing unnecessary re-renders is critical

❌ Don't use when:
- Calculations are simple
- Values change frequently
- Memory usage is a concern

### Performance Tips
1. Profile before optimizing
2. Use Chrome DevTools Performance tab
3. Monitor console logs for calculation frequency
4. Consider the trade-off between computation and memory

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues

1. **Unexpected Recalculations**
   - Check dependency array
   - Verify prop types
   - Monitor component re-renders

2. **Performance Not Improving**
   - Ensure calculation is actually expensive
   - Check if memoization overhead is worth it
   - Verify correct dependency usage

3. **Memory Usage Concerns**
   - Monitor memory usage in DevTools
   - Clear memoized values when no longer needed
   - Consider alternative optimization strategies

## Next Steps
1. Implement memoization in your own project
2. Experiment with different calculation types
3. Add performance monitoring
4. Share your findings with the team

## Conclusion
You've learned how to:
- Implement useMemo for performance optimization
- Identify when to use memoization
- Monitor and verify performance improvements
- Apply best practices in real-world scenarios

Remember: Always measure performance impact before and after implementing useMemo to ensure the optimization is beneficial for your specific use case.

## üîß Architecture Overview

### Custom Hooks

#### 1. useEmployees Hook
```typescript
interface IEmployee {
    id: number;
    firstName: string;
    lastName: string;
    email: string;
    position: string;
    department: string;
    hireDate: string;
}

const useEmployees = () => {
    // State management for employees
    // CRUD operations
    // Error handling
}
```

**Key Features:**
- Local state management with React's useState
- Simulated API delays (500ms)
- CRUD operations for employee data
- Error handling and loading states

#### 2. useEmployeeSearch Hook
```typescript
interface SearchParams {
    query: string;
    field?: keyof IEmployee;
}

const useEmployeeSearch = (employees: IEmployee[]) => {
    // Search functionality
    // Filtering logic
    // Sort operations
}
```

**Key Features:**
- Dynamic search across multiple fields
- Field-specific filtering
- Sort functionality
- Debounced search for performance

#### 3. useEmployeeForm Hook
```typescript
interface FormState {
    values: Partial<IEmployee>;
    errors: Record<keyof IEmployee, string>;
    isValid: boolean;
}

const useEmployeeForm = () => {
    // Form state management
    // Validation logic
    // Error tracking
}
```

**Key Features:**
- Real-time validation
- Field-level error tracking
- Form state management
- Submit handling

### UI Components

The application uses a modern, responsive design built with Tailwind CSS. Key UI features include:
- Gradient backgrounds
- Card-based layout
- Responsive grid system
- Interactive form elements
- Loading states and transitions

## üîç Implementation Details

### State Management
- Local state using React's useState
- Custom hooks for specific functionality
- No external state management library

### Data Flow
1. User interactions trigger hook methods
2. Hooks update local state
3. UI re-renders with updated data
4. Error states are managed at hook level

### Validation Rules
- Required fields: firstName, lastName, email, position
- Email format validation
- Date validation for hireDate
- Dynamic error messaging

### Performance Considerations
- Debounced search operations
- Memoized filtering functions
- Optimized re-renders
- Lazy loading where applicable

## üß™ Testing

### Unit Tests (TODO)
- Hook testing with React Testing Library
- Component rendering tests
- Form validation tests
- Search functionality tests

### Integration Tests (TODO)
- Form submission flow
- Search and filter combinations
- CRUD operations
- Error handling scenarios

## üîê Security Considerations

- Input sanitization
- Form validation
- Type safety with TypeScript
- Protected routes (TODO)
- Authentication (TODO)

## üìà Future Improvements

1. Backend Integration
   - RESTful API implementation
   - Real database connection
   - Authentication system

2. Advanced Features
   - Bulk operations
   - Export functionality
   - Advanced filtering
   - Role-based access

3. Performance Optimizations
   - Code splitting
   - Lazy loading
   - Caching strategies
   - Service workers

## 🔧 Core Components

### Navigation Component
- Location: `src/components/Navigation.tsx`
- Purpose: Provides main navigation structure
- Features:
  - Responsive navigation bar
  - Client-side routing links
  - Hover effects
  - Mobile-friendly design

### Home Page
- Location: `src/pages/Home.tsx`
- Features:
  - Welcome message
  - Call-to-action button
  - Responsive card layout
  - Modern typography

### About Page
- Location: `src/pages/About.tsx`
- Features:
  - Company/Project information
  - Technology stack list
  - Nested card design
  - Responsive layout

## 🎨 Styling
The application uses Tailwind CSS for styling with the following key features:
- Responsive design patterns
- Custom color schemes
- Typography system
- Spacing and layout utilities
- Interactive elements
- Shadow effects

### Key CSS Classes
- Layout: `container`, `min-h-screen`
- Colors: `bg-gray-800`, `text-white`
- Typography: `text-4xl`, `font-bold`
- Spacing: `p-4`, `my-6`
- Flexbox: `flex`, `space-x-6`
- Effects: `hover:text-gray-300`, `transition-colors`

## 🛣️ Routing
React Router v6 is implemented with the following routes:
- `/` - Home page
- `/about` - About page

### Route Configuration
```tsx
<Routes>
  <Route path="/" element={<Home />} />
  <Route path="/about" element={<About />} />
</Routes>
```

## 🔄 State Management
Currently, the application uses React's built-in state management. For larger applications, consider implementing:
- Context API for global state
- Redux/MobX for complex state management
- React Query for server state

## 📱 Responsive Design
The application is fully responsive with:
- Mobile-first approach
- Breakpoint system
- Flexible layouts
- Adaptive typography
- Touch-friendly interactions

## 🏗️ Build and Development
- Development: `npm run dev`
- Build: `npm run build`
- Preview: `npm run preview`
- Lint: `npm run lint`

## 🧪 Testing
To implement testing:
1. Add Jest configuration
2. Write component tests
3. Add integration tests
4. Implement E2E testing

## 📈 Performance Considerations
- Route-based code splitting
- Lazy loading of components
- Image optimization
- CSS purging
- Bundle size optimization

## 🔒 Security
- Input validation
- XSS prevention
- CSRF protection
- Secure routing
- Environment variables

## 🚀 Deployment
1. Build the application
2. Configure environment variables
3. Set up CI/CD pipeline
4. Deploy to hosting platform

## 📦 Dependencies

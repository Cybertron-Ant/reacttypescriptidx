# Week 1: Exploring React and TypeScript

## Agenda
- Setting up the development environment
- Integrating Material-UI
- Building a basic dashboard layout

## What did I learn this week?

Hello everyone! This week, I embarked on an exciting journey with React and TypeScript. Here's a quick rundown of what I did:

First, I set up the project:
```bash
npx create-react-app reacttypescriptidx --template typescript
```

Then, I added Material-UI for styling:
```bash
npm install @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled
npm install @mui/icons-material
```

I learned how to:
- Set up a themed application using `ThemeProvider`
- Create a basic layout structure with `MainLayout`
- Work with TypeScript in React components

## How could I possibly use this in a project?

I've started building a dashboard application. Here's what I've done so far:
- Created a `MainLayout` component for consistent page structure
- Set up a theme configuration
- Built a basic `Dashboard` component

This setup can be used for:
- Admin panels
- Data visualization dashboards
- Project management tools

## What challenge(s) did I face?

1. Integrating TypeScript with Material-UI
2. Structuring a themed application
3. Managing component types properly

## How did I overcome these challenge(s)?

1. I referred to Material-UI's TypeScript documentation.
2. I created a separate theme file for better organization.
3. I used Visual Studio Code's TypeScript suggestions to manage types.

Here's a snippet of the `App.tsx` structure:
```tsx
import { ThemeProvider } from '@mui/material/styles';
import { theme } from './theme/theme';
import { MainLayout } from './components/layout/MainLayout';
import { Dashboard } from './components/features/Dashboard';

function App() {
  // Change these values to test the ternary operator behavior
  const userLoggedIn = true;
  const currentUserName = 'Alice';

  return (
    <ThemeProvider theme={theme}>
      <MainLayout>
        <Dashboard />
      </MainLayout>
    </ThemeProvider>
  );
}

export default App;
```

## Recap

To recap, this week I:
- Set up a React project with TypeScript
- Integrated Material-UI for styling
- Built a basic dashboard layout
- Overcame challenges with TypeScript and Material-UI integration

## What can we expect to see next week?

- Adding interactive dashboard widgets
- Implementing data fetching
- Creating custom themed components
- Adding navigation features

That's all for this week! Any questions? ðŸ¤”

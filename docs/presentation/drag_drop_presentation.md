## What Did I Learn This Week? (3 minutes)

Hey everyone! This week, I learned how to let users drag and drop things in our app. Let me show you how I started:

First, I had to install some helper tools:
```bash
npm install react-dnd
npm install react-dnd-html5-backend
npm install @reduxjs/toolkit
npm install react-redux
```

Each tool helps us in a different way:
- `react-dnd`: Lets us add drag and drop to our app
- `react-dnd-html5-backend`: Makes it work in web browsers
- `@reduxjs/toolkit`: Helps us keep track of what's happening
- `react-redux`: Connects everything together

I learned how to:
- Let users drag items around
- Show them where they can drop items
- Remember what items they've moved

## How Could I Use This in Real Projects? (3 minutes)

Let me show you what I built! Right now, when you drag something:
- You see where you can drop it
- The drop area lights up in blue
- It remembers what you've dropped there

Think about using this for:
- Uploading files by dragging them in
- Moving tasks between "To Do" and "Done" lists
- Arranging photos in an album

## What Problems Did I Run Into? (3 minutes)

I faced two main problems:

1. Keeping Track of Everything:
   Imagine if every shopping aisle in a store had its own separate cart:
   - You pick up milk from aisle 1 and put it in cart 1
   - You pick up bread from aisle 2 and put it in cart 2
   - Now you have milk in one cart and bread in another!

   That's what would happen if I used useState - every part of my app would have its own separate list. Instead, I needed one main cart (Redux) where all parts of my app could see and share the same items.

2. Making It Feel Natural:
   - Showing users where they can drop things
   - Making sure it feels smooth
   - Handling mistakes

## How Did I Fix These Problems? (2 minutes)

To keep track of everything, I used something called a Redux slice. It's like your shopping cart at a store:

When you're shopping:
- You pick up an item from a shelf (that's dragging)
- You put it in your cart (that's dropping)
- Your cart keeps track of everything you've added

My code does the same thing:
- It knows what item you're currently holding
- It keeps a list of everything in your cart
- You can always look in your cart to see what's there

Here's what this looks like in code:
```typescript
const dragDropSlice = createSlice({
  name: 'dragDrop',
  initialState,
  reducers: {
    // Remember which item is being dragged
    setDraggedItem: (state, action: PayloadAction<string | null>) => {
      state.draggedItem = action.payload;
    },
    // Add a dropped item to our list
    addDroppedItem: (state, action: PayloadAction<string>) => {
      state.droppedItems.push(action.payload);
    },
  },
});
```

To make it feel natural:
- The drop area glows when you hover over it
- Items move smoothly
- You can always see what's happening

## Quick Recap (1 minute)
So, what did we cover?
- We learned how to let users drag and drop things
- We used a shopping cart system (Redux) to keep track of everything in one place
- We found out why having separate lists (useState) wouldn't work - just like having separate shopping carts would be confusing
- We made it look and feel smooth for users

## What's Coming Next Week? (2 minutes)

I'm excited to add:
1. The ability to drag multiple things at once
2. Some nice animations when dropping items

That's all from me! Any questions?
